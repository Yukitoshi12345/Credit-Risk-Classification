<h1 align = "center"> Credit Risk Classification </h1>

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess credit risk using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending service. The primary goal is to build a model that accurately identifies the creditworthiness of borrowers, differentiating between healthy loans and high-risk loans. By analysing a dataset of past lending activities, the process involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, applying logistic regression, and evaluating the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The approach involves creating a logistic regression model to predict loan outcomes, utilising various machine learning techniques. The analysis includes fitting the model with training data and assessing its effectiveness with testing data. Key performance indicators, such as the confusion matrix and classification report, are used to evaluate how well the model predicts both healthy and high-risk loans. The objective is to provide a clear recommendation on whether the model is suitable for identifying credit risk, based on its predictive accuracy and reliability.

## Criteria

```
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- Read the lending_data.csv data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create the labels set `y` from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features `x`    
  DataFrame from the remaining columns.
    - A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1  
      means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
- Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
- Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) 
  and the fitted model.
- Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
    - Generate a confusion matrix.
    -  Print the classification report.
- Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 
  0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models.

- Ensure it contains the following:
    - An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    - The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score and 
      recall score of the machine learning model.
    - A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your 
      justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

## Data

This project utilises a primary CSV data source to analyse loan risk based on historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending service. The dataset, generated by edX Boot Camps LLC for educational purposes, offers a realistic foundation for applying machine learning techniques to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.

| Column                       | Description                                                                           | Information                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loan_size | The size of the loan requested by the borrower, represented in monetary units. | This value indicates the amount of money borrowed by an individual from the lending service. |
| interest_rate | The interest rate applied to the loan, represented as a percentage. | This rate determines the cost of borrowing the loan amount and affects the overall repayment amount. |
| borrower_income | The annual income of the borrower, represented in monetary units. | This value provides an indication of the borrower's financial capability to repay the loan. |
| debt_to_come | The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower, calculated as the borrower's total monthly debt payments divided by their monthly gross income. | This ratio is used to assess the borrower's ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts. |
| num_of_accounts | The total number of active credit accounts the borrower has. | This includes all open credit accounts such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages. It helps to evaluate the borrower's credit management behaviour. |
| derogatory_marks | The number of derogatory marks on the borrower's credit report. | Derogatory marks are negative records like late payments, bankruptcies, or charge-offs that can affect the borrower's creditworthiness. |
| total_debt | The total amount of debt currently owed by the borrower, represented in monetary units. | This includes all outstanding debts and is used to assess the borrower's financial obligations. |
| loan_status | The status of the loan, where 0 indicates a "healthy loan" (i.e., a loan with a low risk of default) and 1 indicates a "high-risk loan" (i.e., a loan with a high likelihood of default). | This is the target variable used for predicting credit risk. |
